Created a pipeline in Azure Data Factory where data is extracted and the data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage. Implemented Spark code on Azure Databricks to transform data. Loaded the transformed data on to Azure Data Lake Storage and get insights from it using SQL through Azure Synapse Analytics and built visualization on top of it.
